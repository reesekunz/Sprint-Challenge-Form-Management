# Why are forms used so often in web applications and software?
Forms are an effective way to get data from the user’s input. 
We can then store the state or user data using libraries like Redux and use that data elsewhere (displaying, analyzing, etc.). Without forms, our applications would be more one-dimensional in the sense that it would be more difficult to receive information from the user. 

# What advantages are there by using a forms library like Formik?
Formik make creating forms so much more simple as they take care of a lot of the code that goes into building out a form for you. With Formik, we don’t have to worry about things such as wiring up state, form validation, error messages, etc.

# Why do we write tests for our apps?
We test because it will help us find bugs quicker, prevents us from having to test the app manually (which is more expensive and time consuming), and it ensures that our code is running as expected. Tests also provide as a source of documentation for other developers to look back and get an understanding of the app’s interface.
